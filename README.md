## üìñ Prepare
To get started, prepare two text files:

1. **Words to Link Together** - Contains the words from your own team.
2. **Words to Avoid** - Contains:
    - Your opponent's words
    - Neutral words
    - The assassin word

One word per line. Refer to the [`examples`](examples) directory for sample files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configure
Here are what you need to configure before running mastermind:
- API key
- The base URL of an OpenAI-compatible API
- A default language model

There are two ways to configure this program:
### Config File
During the first run, a config file will be created at your system's preferred location. The specific location will be given in the output. Generally, it is located at:
- For Linux: `$HOME/.config/mastermind/config.toml`
- For macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/mastermind/config.toml`
- For Windows: `C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\mastermind\config.toml`

### Environment Variables
Make a copy of [`example.env`](example.env) and name it `.env`

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Then edit `.env` and provide you preferred configuration.

Alternatively, you can simply pass these environment variables during run time.


## üèÉ Run

```bash
mastermind [TO_LINK] [TO_AVOID]
```

Feel free to run the program multiple times to get the best result!
